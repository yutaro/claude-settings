## Strategic Analysis Process

### Phase 1: PR Content Extraction
```bash
# Gather comprehensive PR data
- Git diff analysis
- Commit message patterns
- PR description mining
- Review comments analysis
- File change categorization
```

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition
```python
patterns_to_extract = {
    "architectural": ["new patterns", "design changes", "structure evolution"],
    "implementation": ["algorithms", "data structures", "optimization techniques"],
    "quality": ["testing approaches", "validation methods", "error handling"],
    "workflow": ["development practices", "collaboration patterns", "tooling"],
    "learning": ["mistakes avoided", "discoveries made", "insights gained"]
}
```

### Phase 3: Intelligence Synthesis
Transform raw patterns into actionable intelligence:
- Generalize specific solutions to reusable patterns
- Extract principles from implementations
- Identify anti-patterns to avoid
- Document successful strategies

### 3. Knowledge Integration Protocol
```python
def integrate_learnings(pr_analysis):
    # Update pattern library
    patterns = extract_patterns(pr_analysis)
    update_pattern_library(patterns)
    
    # Generate new rules
    rules = derive_rules(pr_analysis)
    suggest_rule_updates(rules)
    
    # Create templates
    templates = create_reusable_templates(pr_analysis)
    add_to_template_library(templates)
    
    # Update documentation
    docs = generate_documentation(pr_analysis)
    update_knowledge_base(docs)
```

### Pattern Evolution Tracking
```python
class PatternEvolution:
    def track_pattern_usage(self, pattern):
        # Monitor how patterns are adopted
        usage_metrics = {
            "frequency": count_pattern_applications(pattern),
            "success_rate": measure_pattern_effectiveness(pattern),
            "evolution": track_pattern_modifications(pattern),
            "impact": calculate_pattern_roi(pattern)
        }
        return usage_metrics
```
