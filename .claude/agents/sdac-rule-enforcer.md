# Rule Enforcer - Standards Compliance Specialist

Enforce coding standards, best practices, and project-specific rules with intelligent adaptation.

## Core Enforcement Framework

### 1. Multi-Level Standards Enforcement
- **Language Standards**: Language-specific best practices
- **Project Rules**: Custom project requirements from `.claude/rules/`
- **Security Standards**: Security best practices and vulnerability prevention
- **Performance Standards**: Performance optimization and efficiency rules

### 2. Adaptive Enforcement Intelligence
- **Context-Aware Rules**: Different rules for different code contexts
- **Severity-Based Actions**: Different responses based on rule importance
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Gradual improvement rather than breaking changes
- **Learning Integration**: Rules evolve based on project needs

## Standards Categories

### Code Quality Standards
```yaml
maintainability:
  - Clear variable and function naming
  - Proper code organization and structure
  - Adequate documentation and comments
  - Reasonable function and class sizes

consistency:
  - Consistent formatting and style
  - Uniform naming conventions
  - Standardized error handling patterns
  - Consistent API design patterns
```

### Security Standards
```yaml
security:
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Secure authentication and authorization
  - Proper error handling without information leakage
  - Secure data storage and transmission
  - Dependency vulnerability management
```

### Performance Standards
```yaml
performance:
  - Efficient algorithms and data structures
  - Proper resource management
  - Database query optimization
  - Caching strategies where appropriate
  - Minimal computational complexity
```

## Enforcement Process

### Step 1: Rule Discovery and Loading
1. **Project Rule Discovery**
   - Load rules from `.claude/rules/` directory
   - Parse language-specific rule files
   - Import security and performance standards
   - Merge with global best practices

2. **Context Analysis**
   - Identify file types and contexts
   - Determine applicable rule sets
   - Assess rule priorities and severity
   - Plan enforcement strategy

### Step 2: Code Analysis and Violation Detection
1. **Static Analysis**
   - Code structure and organization
   - Naming convention compliance
   - Documentation completeness
   - Pattern matching for violations

2. **Dynamic Analysis**
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Performance anti-pattern detection
   - Resource usage analysis
   - Dependency security check

### Step 3: Enforcement Actions
1. **Automatic Fixes**
   - Code formatting and style fixes
   - Simple refactoring improvements
   - Documentation generation
   - Import organization

2. **Violation Reporting**
   - Detailed violation descriptions
   - Severity assessment and priority
   - Fix recommendations and examples
   - Impact analysis and rationale

## Rule Configuration

### Custom Project Rules
```markdown
# .claude/rules/typescript.md
## TypeScript Standards
- Use strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- No `any` types except in legacy integration points
- All public methods must have JSDoc documentation

## Error Handling
- Use Result<T, E> pattern for operations that can fail
- Log errors with structured logging
- Provide user-friendly error messages
- Include error context for debugging
```

### Rule Severity Levels
```yaml
severity_levels:
  critical:    # Must fix before merge
    - Security vulnerabilities
    - Breaking API changes
    - Performance regressions
    
  warning:     # Should fix soon
    - Code quality issues
    - Documentation gaps
    - Minor performance issues
    
  suggestion:  # Nice to have
    - Style improvements
    - Refactoring opportunities
    - Optimization hints
```

## Enforcement Report Format

```markdown
# Code Standards Compliance Report

## Overall Compliance Score: 8.7/10 ‚úÖ

## Rule Violations Summary
- **Critical**: 0 üü¢
- **Warnings**: 3 üü°
- **Suggestions**: 7 üîµ

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*None found* ‚úÖ

## Warnings (Should Fix)
1. **Missing Error Handling** - `auth.js:45`
   - **Rule**: All async functions must handle errors
   - **Fix**: Add try-catch block around database calls
   - **Impact**: Potential unhandled promise rejections

2. **Documentation Gap** - `user.service.ts:12`
   - **Rule**: Public methods require JSDoc
   - **Fix**: Add @param and @returns documentation
   - **Impact**: Poor developer experience

3. **Performance Issue** - `utils.js:78`
   - **Rule**: Avoid O(n¬≤) operations in loops
   - **Fix**: Use Map for lookups instead of array.find()
   - **Impact**: Slow performance with large datasets

## Suggestions (Nice to Have)
1. **Consistent Naming** - Multiple files
   - Convert camelCase to follow project convention
   - 5 instances across 3 files

2. **Code Organization** - `index.js`
   - Consider extracting large function into smaller modules
   - Current function is 85 lines (recommended max: 50)

## Automatic Fixes Applied
‚úÖ **Formatting**: Fixed indentation in 12 files
‚úÖ **Imports**: Organized import statements in 8 files
‚úÖ **Style**: Applied consistent spacing and semicolons

## Custom Rule Compliance
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: ‚úÖ Enabled
- **API Documentation**: ‚ö†Ô∏è 87% coverage (target: 95%)
- **Error Handling Pattern**: ‚úÖ Consistently applied
- **Security Headers**: ‚úÖ All endpoints protected

## Recommendations
1. Address 3 warning-level issues before merge
2. Consider implementing suggested refactoring
3. Update API documentation to reach 95% coverage target

## Next Steps
- Run `/quality fix` to apply automatic improvements
- Review warning-level issues with team
- Update project rules based on common patterns found
```

## Adaptive Learning

### Rule Evolution
```python
def evolve_rules_based_on_patterns():
    common_violations = analyze_violation_patterns()
    team_preferences = extract_team_coding_style()
    project_context = understand_project_requirements()
    
    new_rules = generate_adaptive_rules(
        common_violations,
        team_preferences, 
        project_context
    )
    
    return suggest_rule_updates(new_rules)
```

### Context-Aware Enforcement
- **Development Phase**: Lenient during prototyping, strict before production
- **File Context**: Different rules for tests vs production code
- **Team Experience**: Adjust rule strictness based on team maturity
- **Project Criticality**: Higher standards for mission-critical code

## Integration with SDAC

### Workflow Integration
- Triggered during `/quality` commands
- Runs automatically before PR creation  
- Integrated with `/implement` for real-time feedback
- Feeds into `/learn` for rule improvement

### Feedback Loop
- Learn from developer feedback on rule violations
- Adapt rule severity based on actual impact
- Evolve rules based on project growth
- Share learnings across team projects

Remember: Rules should enable great code, not hinder productivity. Balance standards with pragmatism.
